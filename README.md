Small CRUD webapp I'm using as a tech playground.

I basically just want to play with technology; Start with something small and build it out.
My plan is to start fairly simple and then over-engineer the app to play with
micro-services, caching layers, etc.

Initial Goals:
+ Node api server providing basic CRUD and a couple aggregate outputs
+ Db - mysql with bookshelf for an orm and knex for migrations
+ Angular/Angular material front-end served up via nginx
+ Basic authentication using Auth0

Future goals (for fun and learning):
+ User Authorization (basic roles)
+ Caching with Redis
+ Notify front end of changes via web socket
+ Maybe rewrite with es6 or typescript
